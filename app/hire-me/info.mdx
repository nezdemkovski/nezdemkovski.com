# Hello dear stranger!

It seems you have an interesting job offer for me, and I directed you here. **It's a fortunate coincidence, as I'm
currently seeking new opportunities!**

I appreciate your interest in me as a candidate. I value your time as much as I value my own, so let's
make the most of it. I receive a great number of messages on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nezdemkovski), almost all of which are irrelevant.
To streamline this process, I've created this introduction.

My name is **Yuri**, and I'm a **Web Developer** with more than 10 years of
experience in the field.

Previously, I worked as a

- Developer at [Matrix Requirements GmbH](https://matrixreq.com/), where I contributed to modernizing
legacy codebases, implemented React microfrontends, and participated in the development of an in-house
UI library and adoption of a monorepo structure.

- Engineering manager and Tech Lead at [Igluu](https://igluu.cz/) where I had a key role in building
the team, establishing development processes, and enhancing the platform's user experience for a seamless
home buying and renting journey.

- Developer at [LiveScore.com](https://livescore.com/) where my team and I were building a better
version of the web using top-notch frontend technologies and tools.

- Tech Lead at [Oak's Lab](https://www.oakslab.com/). I led teams of Software Engineers
both in the Web and Mobile fields.

All I expect you to do is to meet only a few criteria before you're going to contact me and offer
a new role:

- Your tech stack align with my expertise in JavaScript. I am proficient in *React.js*, while my
backends typically employ a powerful *Node.js + GraphQL combo*. I'm also proficient in *REST* and
*gRPC* APIs. Naturally, all my projects are built with *TypeScript*. Additionally, I'm comfortable
with various cloud platforms and languages like Python and Go.

- Your organization is dedicated to building and evolving its own products, not an outsourcing
agency. I'm seeking a role where I can have a meaningful, long-term impact on product development.

- The company has the capability to operate seamlessly in a fully remote environment. As working across
various countries and time zones becomes increasingly prevalent, I am eager to contribute my
expertise in establishing an async-first culture.

- My usual daily rate starts at *500 EUR (12k CZK)* or *125,000 EUR/year*. I operate under a Czech
entity, which allows for flexible B2B arrangements â€” this is my preferred way of collaboration.

- (optional) At this stage in my career, I'm seeking roles that combine hands-on development with technical
leadership, such as Tech Lead or Engineering Manager positions. I find great satisfaction
in balancing coding with guiding and mentoring teams.

- (optional) Your company values the integration of AI and LLMs in work processes,
recognizing their potential to enhance productivity and innovation.

- (optional) I'm a passionate supporter of the Open Source philosophy, and I'm looking for a job and
colleagues who share my enthusiasm. I look forward to collaborating on Open Source projects and
contributing to the community together!

Checked every point above carefully and you are pretty sure that *I'm the guy* and *you are that 1%*?
Please drop me an email at [yuri@nezdemkovski.com](mailto:yuri@nezdemkovski.com) or book a quick
call in my [Calendar](https://cal.com/nezdemkovski/quick-chat).

P.S. These are the technologies I use on a daily basis (mmm, buzzwords): JavaScript, TypeScript,
React.js, Node.js, Next.js, Styled-components, Tailwind, Apollo Client/Urql, GraphQL,
GraphQL Code Generator, SQL/NoSQL databases, Prisma, AWS, Supabase, Google Cloud.

Cheers,

Yuri Nezdemkovski
