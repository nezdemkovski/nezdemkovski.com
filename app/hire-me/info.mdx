# Hello dear stranger!

It seems you have an interesting job offer for me, and I directed you here. **It's a fortunate coincidence, as I'm
currently seeking new opportunities!**

I appreciate your interest in me as a candidate. I value your time as much as I value my own, so let's
make the most of it. I receive a great number of messages on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nezdemkovski), almost all of which are irrelevant.
To streamline this process, I've created this introduction.

My name is **Yuri**, and I'm a **Web Developer** with more than 10 years of
experience in the field.

Previously, I worked as a:

- **Developer** at [Matrix Requirements GmbH](https://matrixreq.com/): I contributed to building a modern UI library, introduced React microfrontends, and led the adoption of a monorepo structure, driving efficiency and scalability in a compliance-driven environment.

- **Engineering Manager and Tech Lead** at [LiveScore](https://livescore.com/): I built and scaled a high-performing team, established robust development processes, and led the successful transformation of the website, resulting in a significantly faster and more engaging platform for millions of users.

- **Tech Lead** at [Oak's Lab](https://www.oakslab.com/): I guided cross-functional teams to deliver impactful web and mobile projects, ensuring high-quality outputs and on-time delivery. My leadership extended to strategic technical decision-making and mentoring.

- **Developer** at [Kiwi.com](https://kiwi.com/): I contributed to the development of one of the first open GraphQL APIs in the Czech Republic and drove the adoption of TypeScript, improving code quality and developer efficiency across internal projects.

All I expect you to do is to meet only a few criteria before you're going to contact me and offer
a new role:

- Your tech stack align with my expertise in JavaScript. I am proficient in *React.js*, while my
backends typically employ a powerful *Node.js + GraphQL combo*. I'm also proficient in *REST* and
*gRPC* APIs. Naturally, all my projects are built with *TypeScript*. Additionally, I'm comfortable
with various cloud platforms and languages like Python and Go.

- Your organization is dedicated to building and evolving its own products, not an outsourcing
agency. I'm seeking a role where I can have a meaningful, long-term impact on product development.

- The company has the capability to operate seamlessly in a fully remote environment. As working across
various countries and time zones becomes increasingly prevalent, I am eager to contribute my
expertise in establishing an async-first culture.

- My usual daily rate starts at *500 EUR (12k CZK)* or *125,000 EUR/year*. I operate under a Czech
entity, which allows for flexible B2B arrangements â€” this is my preferred way of collaboration.

- (optional) At this stage in my career, I'm seeking roles that combine hands-on development with technical
leadership, such as Tech Lead or Engineering Manager positions. I find great satisfaction
in balancing coding with guiding and mentoring teams.

- (optional) Your company values the integration of AI and LLMs in work processes,
recognizing their potential to enhance productivity and innovation.

- (optional) I'm a passionate supporter of the Open Source philosophy, and I'm looking for a job and
colleagues who share my enthusiasm. I look forward to collaborating on Open Source projects and
contributing to the community together!

Checked every point above carefully and you are pretty sure that *I'm the guy* and *you are that 1%*?
Please drop me an email at [yuri@nezdemkovski.com](mailto:yuri@nezdemkovski.com) or book a quick
call in my [Calendar](https://cal.com/nezdemkovski/quick-chat).

P.S. These are the technologies I use on a daily basis (mmm, buzzwords): JavaScript, TypeScript,
React.js, Node.js, Next.js, Styled-components, Tailwind, Apollo Client/Urql, GraphQL,
GraphQL Code Generator, SQL/NoSQL databases, Prisma, AWS, Supabase, Google Cloud.

Cheers,

Yuri Nezdemkovski
