# Hello dear stranger!

It seems you have an interesting job offer for me, and I directed you here. **It's a fortunate coincidence, as I'm
currently seeking new opportunities!**

I appreciate your interest in me as a candidate. I value your time as much as I value my own, so let's
make the most of it. I receive a great number of messages on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nezdemkovski), almost all of which are irrelevant.
To avoid this, I had an idea. Before I explain it, let me introduce myself.

My name is **Yuri**, and I'm a **Web Developer** with more than 10 years of
experience in the field.

Previously, I worked as a

- Engineering manager and Tech Lead at [Igluu](https://igluu.cz/) where I had a key role in building
the team, establishing development processes, and enhancing the platform's user experience for a seamless
home buying and renting journey.

- Developer at [LiveScore.com](https://livescore.com/) where my team and I were building a better
version of the web using top-notch frontend technologies and tools.

- Tech Lead at [Oak's Lab](https://www.oakslab.com/) (I led teams of Software Engineers
both in the Web and Mobile fields)

- [Kiwi.com](https://kiwi.com/) is a place where I had a chance to work on the best aggregator and
booking service for airline tickets.

All I expect you to do is to meet only a few criteria before you're going to contact me and offer
a new role:

- At this stage in my career, I find great satisfaction in not only being a developer but also
taking on the role of an Engineering Manager. As such, I am shifting my focus
and giving priority to technical managerial positions.

- The company has the capability to operate seamlessly in a fully remote environment. As working across
various countries and time zones becomes increasingly prevalent, I am eager to contribute my
expertise in establishing an async-first culture. Drawing from my extensive knowledge acquired
since late 2022 through diverse sources, I am well-equipped to support your transition to a remote
work culture.

- As for my technical expertise, I excel in using *TypeScript* to address a wide range of work
requirements. On the client-side, I am proficient in *React.js*, while my backends typically
employ a powerful *Node.js + GraphQL combo*. My skill set extends beyond these technologies,
as I am also well-versed in REST and gRPC, demonstrating my adaptability and eagerness
to explore new solutions.

- I'm a passionate supporter of the Open Source philosophy, and I'm looking for a job and
colleagues who share my enthusiasm. I look forward to collaborating on Open Source projects and
contributing to the community together!

- My usual daily rate starts at *500 EUR (12k CZK)* or *125,000 EUR/year*.

Checked every point above carefully and you are pretty sure that *I'm the guy* and *you are that 1%*?
Please drop me an email at [yuri@nezdemkovski.com](mailto:yuri@nezdemkovski.com) or book a quick
call in my [Calendar](https://cal.com/nezdemkovski/quick-chat).

P.S. These are the technologies I use on a daily basis (mmm, buzzwords): JavaScript, TypeScript,
React.js, Node.js, Next.js, Styled-components, Tailwind, Apollo Client/Urql, GraphQL,
GraphQL Code Generator, SQL/NoSQL databases, Prisma, AWS, Supabase, Google Cloud.

Cheers,

Yuri Nezdemkovski
